- allows user to navigate different functions
by providing a menu

validate_choice()
- takes 2 arguments, the value and numer of choices
- checks user input is valid

direct_user()
- takes 1 argument, choice
- takes user to chosen function based on the number
they have input

add_contact()
- provides user with input fields for first name, last
name, number, email, address
- runs inputs through validators and adds values to spreadsheet

validate_name()
- takes 1 argument for name
- checks name input valid

validate_number()
- takes 1 argument, number
- checks number input valid

validate_address()
- takes 1 argument, address
- checks address input valid

validate_email()
- takes 1 argument, email
- checks email input valid

remove_contact()
- allows user to delete contact row in spreadsheet

search_workbook()
- takes 2 arguments, term, function

delete_all()
- clears all data in spreadsheet

validate_key()
- takes 1 argument, pressed_key
- checks if the user has pressed 'y' or 'n'
- required when user wants to delete something

search_contact()
